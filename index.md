What is HENkaku?
===============================================================================
![VitaDoom](/assets/vitadoom-hero.png){:class="pull-right"}
HENkaku is the first ever *homebrew enabler* for PS Vita and PS Vita TV. It is akin to jailbreaking your iPhone or rooting your Android device.

Homebrew are games and other software not officially approved. For example, [VitaDoom](https://github.com/xyzz/Vita_Doom/releases/latest) is a port of the classic game DOOM and [mGBA](https://mgba.io/) lets you play Game Boy Advance ROMs. You can find more examples in the [showcase](/showcase/).

Best of all, HENkaku is 100% free. No cost. No ads. No "donations".

How do I get it?
===============================================================================
Visit **{{ site.url }}** from the built-in web browser on your PS Vita and press the "Install" button to install HENkaku. You must do this *every time you reboot the console*--that is, every time you turn the console off and on again.

What are the requirements?
===============================================================================
You need a PS Vita or PS Vita TV running system firmware **higher than 3.51**, this page only fully supports system version **3.60**, if you have a device in a higher version, check out [vita.hacks.guide](https://vita.hacks.guide).

In order to transfer homebrew to your device, you also need a FTP client for your computer. We recommend [FileZilla](https://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/). Finally, you need an internet connection to install HENkaku.

tl;dr:

  * Vita on firmware 3.60
  * Internet connection
  * FTP client on your PC

{: .text-warning}
3.55 and 3.57 currently do not install molecularShell.
